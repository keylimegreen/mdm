Local anesthetic lidocaine was administered to the lateral canthus. Tissue was devascularized with a hemastat clamp for at least 60 seconds. Using iris scissors, a full-thickness incision was made at the lateral canthus. The feinrior lateral canthal crus was identified and transected with scissors. Hemostasis was achieved.\nFindings: Immediate decrease in proptosis and reduction in intraocular pressure.\nComplications: None."
