        "Incidental radiology findings": "Please note that during the course of your emergency room visit we found an indeterminate lesion on your radiology diagnostic testing today. Outpatient follow-up imaging is necessary to further evaluate indeterminate findings identified during emergency radiology studies. These findings may represent early or subtle pathology not fully characterized in the acute setting. Timely follow-up ensures accurate diagnosis, guides appropriate treatment, and helps detect or rule out serious conditions, such as malignancy or evolving disease, that may not be apparent initially.",
        "Abnormal laboratory findings": "Please note that during the course of your emergency room visit we also found mildly abnormal labotory values. Outpatient follow-up for mildly abnormal laboratory findings is important to monitor for progression, resolution, or emerging disease. These results may indicate early signs of an underlying condition that is not yet clinically apparent. Repeat testing or further evaluation ensures accurate diagnosis, guides management, and helps prevent potential complications.",
        "Pending tests": "There are diagnostic tests still pending, which may take a few days to result. If any results are concerning or require follow-up, we will contact you at the phone number you provided."
